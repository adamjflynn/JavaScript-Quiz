# JavaScript-Quiz
The purpose of this project was to create an interactive quiz involving JavaScript and DOM methods to dynamically manipulate the HTML of the page to switch from a question determining if the answer was correct or incorrect.

- Utilized querySelectors to how the application should interact with the browser.
-  Used event listeners to allow the application to determine what happens next.
